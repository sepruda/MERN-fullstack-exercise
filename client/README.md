# MERN-fullstack-exercise

This is a MERN-stack exercise (MongoDB, Express, React and Node). The [code](https://github.com/beaucarnes/mern-exercise-tracker-mongodb) is from the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) but is quite heavily refactored using only function components with hooks, arrow functions instead of databinding and combining components.
